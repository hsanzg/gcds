This crate implements several algorithms for finding the greatest
common divisor of two single-precision numbers.

The _greatest common divisor_ $\gcd(u,v)$ of two integers $u$ and $v$,
not both zero, is the largest integer that evenly divides them both.
This definition does not apply when $u$ and $v$ are both zero, since
every number divides zero; for convenience, all the algorithms adhere
to the convention that $\gcd(0,0)=0$.
