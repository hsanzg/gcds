This crate implements several algorithms for finding the greatest
common divisor of two single-precision numbers.

The _greatest common divisor_ $\gcd(u,v)$ of two integers $u$ and $v$,
not both zero, is the largest integer that evenly divides them both.
This definition does not apply when $u$ and $v$ are both zero, since
every number divides zero; for convenience, all the algorithms adhere
to the convention that $\gcd(0,0)=0$.

This crate is by no means a complete catalog of gcd subroutines, but it
does provide implementations of many of the most significant and most
efficient methods that are currently known. Included, for example, are:

- `euclid`: The modern version of the Euclidean algorithm, as described in
  Algorithm 4.5.2A of [_The Art of Computer Programming_][taocp].
- `binary_stein`: The binary gcd algorithm of J. Stein [["Computational Problems Associated with Racah Algebra,"][stein]
  _J. Comp. Phys._ **1** (1967), 397--405].
- `binary_bonzini`: an optimized variant of the binary gcd algorithm proposed
  by P. Bonzini, and studied by D. Lemire [["Greatest common divisor, the extended Euclidean algorithm, and speed!"][lemire]
  (April 2024)].
- `binary_brent`: an alternative formulation of the binary gcd algorithm
  proposed by R. P. Brent [[_"Further analysis of the Binary Euclidean algorithm,"_][brent]
  Technical Report PRG TR-7--99 (Oxford Univ. Computing Laboratory, 1999),
  Section 5].
- `binary_brent_kung`: a variant of the binary gcd algorithm suitable for
  implementation on a systolic array [R. P. Brent and H. T. Kung, _IEEE
  Symposium on Computer Arithmetic_ **7** (1985), [118--125][systolic]].
- `harris`: a cross between Euclid's algorithm and the binary gcd algorithm
  proposed by V. C. Harris \[_The Fibonacci Quarterly_ **8** (1970),
  [102--103][harris]].

Each subroutine is programmed in a [literate] style, and includes a short
proof of correctness.
